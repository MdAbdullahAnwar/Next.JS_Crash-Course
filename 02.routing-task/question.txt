Deliverable:
Task 1: Basic Routing

Create /app/page.js that displays the welcome message:
Welcome to the Products Store
Create /app/products/page.js that displays a simple placeholder text indicating the products page and includes links to product pages for product IDs 1 through 10.


Task 2: Dynamic Route Placeholder

Create /app/products/[id]/page.js that displays a framed static message:
Product [id] details page â€” content coming soon!
where [id] is dynamic and reflects the product ID in the URL.
